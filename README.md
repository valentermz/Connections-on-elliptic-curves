# Logarithmic connections on elliptic curves

This repository is ancilliary to the paper:  

* F. Loray and V. Ramírez. *A map between moduli spaces of connections*. [arxiv: 1910.13535v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13535).

We study a moduli space of rank 2 logarithmic sl2-connections on an elliptic curve having two poles. To do so, we investigate certain logarithmic rank 2 connections defined on the Riemann sphere and a transformation rule to lift such connections to the elliptic curve via a ramified degree 2 covering map.

The Jupyter notebook `A-map-between-moduli-spaces.ipynb` containes the computations discussed in the paper.

In `Additional-materials/` we have added some material not discussed in the paper.
