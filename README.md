# Logarithmic connections on elliptic curves

These computations are work in progress for my research project at IRMAR.

We're studying rank 2 meromorphic connections over a (complex) elliptic curve C having exactly two logarithmic singularities. Consider the quotient of C by its elliptic involution. This defines a map from the curve C to the Riemann sphere. We have to approaches:

* Push connections from C to P1 and study them there. This process creates connections of rank 4 having 5 singularities.

* Consider a family of connections over C that are obtained from pulling-back connections defined over P1. We assume the original connections have apparent singularities at the 2-torsion points and one logarithmic singularity otherwise.
